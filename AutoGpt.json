Life is complicated. Ecosystems are complicated. Alex Tabarrok writes, “The law of unintended consequences is what happens when a simple system tries to regulate a complex system.” This so often happens in any kind of government program, regulation, law or attempt to control something within a complex system with a relatively simple action. Things will happen that we didn’t anticipate.\nExamples abound:\nA policy of suppressing forest fires that goes on to cause even greater fires.\nAn attempt in Bogotá to reduce traffic by restricting who could drive each day based on licence plates that led people to circumvent the policy by buying more cars.\nMore open workplaces that cause people to behave more privately.\nElimination of predators that leads to the proliferation of grazing animals and a reduction in diversity.\nThe effects of literally any dam built anywhere.\nWhat happens when you change software.\nDesire paths.\nThe Streisand effect.\nOr social distancing policies that results in outdoor natural spaces being crammed with people at weekends.\nAnd on, and on.\nOften, as with some of these, the outcome can be the opposite of what you intended, known as the cobra effect.\nControlling complex systems is difficult.\nThanks to Bruce Howard for supporting this one.\n62 Comments\nFacebook\nTwitter\nRSS Feed\nprint\nComments\nSort by Top\nSort by Recent\nSort by Controversial\nHadur\n2023-03-31 07:44:45\n49\n1\nHide Replies\n#\nThis, or something like this, is the strongest argument for conservatism, at least in theory. It's not that there aren't terrible injustices out there crying for resolution, it's that government action often makes them worse.\nThe flaw is that people aren't good at accepting this. Somebody ought to do something, and they will vote for the person proposing to do something. What conservatives and limited government types need to get better at is cultivating solutions that sound like they're doing something and appeal to voters in theory, but are by design very limited in effect and thus carry low risk of unintended consequences.\nAn example is targeted airstrikes. Sometimes the public demands that we take military action against a certain country, but going to full-scale war with them would be unwise. So the government orders small-scale airstrikes. This accomplishes little on the ground while mollifying the public's bloodlust. Trump's airstrikes against Syria were textbook examples of these: the Syrians were notified which facilities the US intended to bomb in advance and played along.\nMercatus Center and their ilk would be far more effective if rather than publishing the (n + 1)th argument in favor of free markets they began to cultivate policy solutions that accomplish little (bad or good) but sound like they accomplish a lot of good.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nCan One say Simplism\n2023-03-31 08:05:29\n10\n0\n#\n...except that 99 out of 100 cases are not in the public eye, government parties are not in the picture, and the consequences are not easily defined once we exit the 'attempted intervention'.\nThe takeaway is that this is a simplism that presumes that there exists a solution, a happy ending, or that the existing problem 'was really that bad'.

We live in a world of creative destruction that occurs whether or not we decide to act. Limited actions designed to preserve the status quo always fail eventually, and sometimes spectacularly. In my opinion that’s the best thing about progressives, that they realize they live in a world where radical change is the rule and not the exception. They do tend to overestimate their control over and understanding of these changes, but they are far better prepared to deal with them than conservatives.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nDino the Isaurian\n2023-04-01 00:30:40\n2\n0\nHide Replies\n#\nIn my opinion that’s the best thing about progressives, that they realize they live in a world where radical change is the rule and not the exception.\nI guess that explains their love affair with socialized medicine, choo-choo trains and the post office.\nAll radical 19th century tech that progressive bitterly cling to.\nBecause they embrace creative destruction so much they don’t want to let go of yesterday’s (or great-great-great gandpappy’s).\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nVulcidian\n2023-04-01 19:24:15\n0\n0\n#\nBig words coming from a dinosaur.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nLord Action\n2023-03-31 09:21:30\n15\n1\nHide Replies\n#\nWhile I'm sympathetic to the idea that regulation is usually hamfisted and often makes things worse, it's simply not true that complex systems get more difficult to control as they get more complex.\nThis was a 1980s systems engineering idea that has proven false.\nIn engineering, at least, things have gotten better and better, even as they've gotten more complex.\nIt isn't true that when you change software you have no idea of the consequence - we've developed tools so that the consequences are isolated and understandable.\nThat's how we build complex systems that work.\nSo whatever is going wrong with regulation, this isn't it, at least not fundamentally.\nYou have to explain why regulation isn't building up structures to manage complex systems and unintended consequences.\nAnd in some aspects of government, think military procurement, we've actually gotten pretty good at making the programs successful.\nNot cheap, but predictable and successfull.\nWhy do we get it right there, but not in other places?\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.","Source: https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/the-law-of-unintended-consequences.html\nContent summary part#1: The text discusses the concept of unintended consequences, where a simple system tries to regulate a complex system and results in unexpected outcomes.

If your big fear in life is unintended consequences you will obsess over that one time and forget the other times the change was successful. In which case its 2023 and you are still using DOS.\nThat said, maybe you learned something from that one time. Maybe you shouldn't have changed software, maybe looked at more options, maybe it was unavoidable no matter what you did, hire someone who is better at software.\nSteve\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nLord Action\n2023-03-31 11:12:41\n7\n0\nHide Replies\n#\nEver work in machine language?\nEver read “The Story of Mel, a Real Programmer”?\nBased on your question, I suspect not.\nIt used to be that software was inherently brittle and complex things were hard to do.\nBut people invented tools, structures, languages, algorithms, design patterns, etc.\nAll to tame the complexity and let you build more complicated things that actually work.\nAnd so today, software can do much more complex things than it once did _and_ be more reliable and maintainable at the same time.\nFor some reason this hasn’t happened with regulation.\nMost new regulation is as buffoonish as it always has been.\nMy guess, and it’s only a guess, is that regulation is kind of inherently insulated from competition, and competition is what lets you find out where you’re weak and where you need to improve.\nThis theory also explains why the military seems to work a bit better than the rest of government: its failures are more obvious and on display.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nsteve\n2023-03-31 12:27:21\n0\n0\nHide Replies\n#\nNope (son is a programmer) , but i have had to deal with the consequences of every software change made with our EMRs. Most of the time it goes well. Sometimes there are minor issues they can fix easily. Occasionally its a disaster, especially when the IT guys decide to make improvements without talking with the clinicians. Heck, this goes beyond EMRs. Plenty of people weren't happy with Windows 8 and some of the Apple releases have had significant issues. Anyway, in the long run my EMR is much better. I think my current OS on my home computer is better than the ones 20 years ago.

For the military it's pretty obvious--success means more casualties on the other side, failure means more on our side. For many government programs, however, that's not the case. Is a CERCLA (Superfund) site a success if it prevents people from being exposed to hazardous materials? Or does it need to be cleaned up to count as a success? To what level--ecological, industrial, UU/UE? Cost/benefit calculations come into play on this.\nFor politicians success and failure mean getting re-elected or not. For bureaucrats it means gaining power or losing it. Both, notably, are divorced from outcomes--it's entirely possible (trivially common) to push for a program that fails to achieve its intended objectives, or even harms those objectives, but it gets you voted back into office so it counts as a win. For examples of this see the boarder wall (on the Right) and about 80% of environmental legislation (on the Left). Note that I'm saying nothing about the morality of these; I'm saying that they fail to achieve their objective, but get pushed because they get politicians re-elected and give bureaucrats more power.\nThe free market has the advantage here because it has an objective measure of success--how much profit you make. This is directly driven by success or failure (in most industries, anyway) to achieve some concrete objective. You make money by delivering packages faster and more reliably than your competition.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nBS\n2023-03-31 11:28:08\n3\n1\nHide Replies\n#\nDesigning a control for a complex physical system over which you have total engineering control cannot be liked to attempting to control complex social and political systems.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nLord Action\n2023-03-31 11:33:37\n1\n1\nHide Replies\n#\nWe're going to have to agree to disagree on this.\nLook at e-commerce or social media.\nThose complex systems seem to be getting better and better at achieving what the owners want, even though they have huge social and political components.\nBut, of course, they face actual pressure to review, understand, and improve.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nBS\n2023-03-31 11:37:52\n0\n0\n#\nI suppose if you look at a narrow range of purpose, you can sometimes be correct.\nSocial media, though, seems to be one of those things that regulators are desperate to control but are having a hard time.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nDino the Isaurian\n2023-04-01 00:39:29\n0\n0\n#\nRegulations are just another variation of laws.\nIE the rules of operation in a polity.\nThey are morally and efficaciously neutral in and of themselves. Which is to say that both can be good or bad, effective or ineffectual, consistent or inconsistent, strictly or in-stringently enforced. The\nModern American\nregulatory environment is inconsistent, ineffectual and overly complicated.\nThat does not invalidate the concept of regulation per se and more than the criminality of inner cities ca 2019 invalidated the concepts of law and policing.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nWASD\n2023-04-01 09:32:21\n0\n0\n#\nRegulations rarely have prototypes. And in the rare instance that they do, the results of the various iterations are rarely objectively considered. That is why governmental interventions do not approximate successful engineering solutions. But it is a mistake to paint successful engineering solutions as the norm, at least in my experience. Frequently the outcome of complex engineering projects is to learn that you know a lot less about the system than you originally thought.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nBill Allen\n2023-03-31 08:57:37\n7\n0\nHide Replies\n#\nI have to add: Building flood walls on the Mississippi River to control flooding and having floods become much worse than before.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nAlan Wells\n2023-03-31 09:12:50\n4\n1\nHide Replies\n#\nOr climate change which has both positive and negative components.\nTrade-offs.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\naaron\n2023-04-02 16:27:11\n0\n0\n#\nYes, and policy is pretty certain to make things worse instead of better.","Source: https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/the-law-of-unintended-consequences.html\nContent summary part#2: Extractive summary: The article discusses the limitations of regulation and how it often fails to achieve its intended goals.

There were presentations at GSA for years before the hurricane hit New Orleans, predicting (accurately) exactly how things would go. There were petitions to pretty much anyone who would listen to change things. But since it hadn't been a problem everyone dismissed it. It's a pretty typical attitude: Leave things alone until they break.\nSame thing can be said about barrier islands. They're HIGHLY mobile, often moving several meters during a big storm. Yet people keep building on them and are shocked when the buildings get taken out. (To be fair, larger concerns are aware of this, they just know that insurance and government bailouts will recoup the losses.)\nOr look at houses at the edges of cliffs. I've seen houses right next to boulders half as big as the house--and you could see right where the boulder came through. The house is GOING to get hit. It's not a question of if or when, but rather of whether folks will be home or not. There are ways to protect houses in such locations--but then you see morons who think \"Those houses don't get hit, I'll be fine building next to them\" and ignoring the necessity for those protective measures. Then they're astonished that insurance won't pay to replace the house.\nHawaii does this right. They have areas where you can build if you're stupid enough to, but you can't get insurance--it's very much a \"Build at your own risk\" situation. When you live on an active volcano you sort of need to listen to geologists, whether you want to or not.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nsteve\n2023-03-31 09:21:26\n7\n2\n#\nIts all about trade offs, an even more fundamental rule in economics IMHO. There are very few rules, policies, laws or regulations you can make that dont have a downside and there are always downsides you dont anticipate.\nYou are very aware of if you have ever had to manage people or run a business. You could become paralyzed by that knowing that there will be unintended consequences for anything you do, but the known consequence to that is chaos and non-productivity.\nUnfortunately, when you are in charge everyone will remember and remind you of the policy that didnt work so you had to change it, forgetting the other 20 that are working pretty well, maybe not perfectly but the upsides outweigh the unintended consequences. Libertarians try to play that role in society at large, reminding us of every failure while ignoring the regulations that did work or the bad outcomes in the cases when things were not regulated. Its an important role as it keeps reminding us there are trade offs, but it doesnt mean you should never regulate anything, complex or not.\nSteve\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nAlfred\n2023-03-31 08:43:50\n3\n0\n#\nThis is exactly what people worry about with AI existential risk.

We could (supposedly) wipe out mosquitos with genetic mosquitos. Food chain issues are moot, because animals that eat them can just eat other bugs. But we don't do it, because we're worried about unintended consequences. See also Geo engineering. IMO this is for the best.\nThe one area in biology where engineering has become common in biology is virology and we see how that worked out.

That seems too big a claim.\nAre all these even “regulations?” Surely killing predators is something that has been done from pre-historic times. Damming rivers as well.\nThe inclusion of such examples may suggest that the implication is not so much that human interference in complex systems is to be avoided, but that it’s inevitable.\nAlex doesn’t here define what his point is, but it reminds me of the once pervasive myth that by preserving wilderness we had this area in it’s “natural state, untouched by” humans, when in truth humans had existed there all along and had effects.\nI get the point of unintended consequences and the appeal of the idea that if we just let things alone nature or the market or whatever would do its thing. I’d say I even agree with Alex on most things. But the problem with the idealism of the market and non-regulation is that people are never just leaving it alone, and even when they try not to intervene, they still manage to intervene, so the feeling of purity or whatever it is that libertarians feel about not regulating is an illusion, and subject to the same sorts of cost benefit analysis as any other problem.\nWhile unintended consequences should be a strong factor in this type of analysis, and indeed should often win the day, it is just one factor.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nJWatts\n2023-03-31 11:04:00\n0\n0\n#\nInteresting observation Alex, but while it's an aspect it's not the only one.

So we create a set of common rules for the group, and the rules only work well for a portion of the group, are a wash for another portion and are a net negative for the rest.\nIn order to combat that, we try to further implement standardization rules, so that members of the group are required to be more similar than different. But again that is an imperfect process.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nBS\n2023-03-31 11:34:08\n0\n0\n#\nUltimately, it's just because a relative handful of politicians and staffers and wonks and administrators are trying to out-guess thousands or millions of people.\nNever gonna happen.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nkailer\n2023-03-31 12:49:04\n0\n0\n#\nHousing policy might be the one area where the simple solution is the correct one.

Fires, failures occur, people who know look at what happened, try to figure out why, and how it could be prevented. People in the industry come up with solutions, a rule is written that can be satisfied by products or procedures offered by a competitive market.\nThen you have a jurisdiction that decides to score their inspectors on how many inspections fail. The unintended consequence being an increase in unpermited work. I'm watching this happen right now.\nIn Quebec 55% of construction in the province was underground; no permits, no taxes, no fees, etc. as a result of the ridiculous regulatory structure. A few years ago in a major city in Canada 1 in 5 construction projects were fully permitted, and the regulators acted in a way that punished the one, essentially forcing more contractors to work unpermited.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment","Source: https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2023/03/the-law-of-unintended-consequences.html\nContent summary part#4: Extractive summary: The cartoon illustrates the concept of unintended consequences, where a simple solution to a complex problem can lead to unforeseen negative outcomes.

And yes the costs of a house electrical system has increased.\nThe CSA, the Canadian equivalent of UL was accused of selling access to law making to companies. Corruption is an inevitable unintended consequence when there is so much at stake.\nUL, or Underwriter Laboratories was an insurance driven initiative to limit damages by certifying products, and setting standards for manufacturing.\nInterestingly, in some domains it is swinging back to the insurers away from government. The local inland ferry which is run by government with private operators at one time was inspected by government agents, who were subject to influence by who they worked for when it came to making decisions that would cost money. (this by the way is how Canada got it's finances in order and counteracted the Laffer curve). Now the insurance company sends an inspector who tells them what is needed for them to be insured. The engineers like this arrangement; the inspector knows the fiscal pressure they are under and works with them to get things fixed or replaced, and has the leverage to make it happen.\nThe insurance market is in turmoil right now, and I suspect they will demand more control over what they insure because government regulatory structures are not very effective.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nRebes\n2023-03-31 08:53:17\n2\n4\nHide Replies\n#\nUnintended consequence:\nIndict Trump over something trivial.\nHe beats the charge\nIt’s more difficult to bring charges for more serious offenses.\nRespond\nAdd Comment\nEmail\nAuthor\nWebsite\nComment\nNotify me of follow-up comments by email.\nNotify me of new posts by email.\nSubmit\nCancel\nHonestly?\n2023-03-31 09:08:55\n4\n6\n#\nThe way Trump has (mis)handled sensitive classified information, lied repeatedly about it, and the way he keeps losing in court regarding such things as regards attorney client confidentiality indicate that Trump will lose big in court in a case with an even better paper trail than the NY charge(s).
